Project: ASP.NET Web Forms with jQuery Validation â€“ Employee Form

This project is a simple ASP.NET Web Forms application that demonstrates how to integrate jQuery client-side validation with a server-side form. The application ensures that user input is validated instantly on the client before submitting the data to the server, providing a smoother and more user-friendly experience.
The form collects basic employee details such as Name, Age, Gender, and City, and validates them using jQuery and JavaScript before sending the data to the server for processing. Once the data passes validation, the form submission triggers a server-side event that confirms successful entry.
